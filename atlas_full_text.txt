 which it oames Phifoii , Gehon , Diglathy

 is to finde the other two Rivers, Phifon,

 Almoft all Authors conclude the Nile 
 for Gehon, and the Ganges for Phi^on : but, 
 as the Biile defcribes tliefe Rivers to us, 
 they muft defcend from the fameplace^ 
 which the Tjgrss, the Euphratei, the Nile, 
 and the Ganges cannot do. The Tjgris, 40 
 and the Euphrates have fome Springs, 
 which arc not farr diftant the one from the

 was by his Father defeated -, from whence 
 the place had its name, which fignifies Bt-

 near Agra was built by Ekcbart after having 
 obtained Children to facceed to his E- 
 flates. This Countrey bears the name of 
 Peng-ah. that is, Five Waters, byreafonio 
 it is watered with five different Rivers. 
 
 The Province bf D£ L LT gives name 
 to Its capital City, which is intheRoad 
 from Z4W to Agra •, almoft 50 Leagues 
 from this, and 100 and odd from that, 
 watered by the Kiver Gemini or Semena. 
 Bi'fore the Mogolls defcended into all thefe 
 quarters, the Kings of India made it their 
 Kcfidence, were here Crowned, and here 
 had their Tombs : There are yet found *° 
 fome very fair obtltfques, believed to have 
 beenerededin the tin" of AUx*ndtrx.ht

 The Kingdom of B E NG A L J oc- 
 cupies all the lower part of the Ganges , 
 and may be divided into three parts. Prurtf 
 on this fide the Ganges, Patan beyond it. 
 The particular name of Bengala may be 
 given to that whith lies oetween the 
 Bunches of the Ganges , and along the 3* 
 Coaft. This Kingdom hath been divided 
 into Twelve Provinces , which have been 
 fo many Kingdoms, and which took their 
 names from their principal Cities t but 
 we have no certain knowledge either of 
 their names, or fcituations, Bengala like- 
 wifc is placed by fome between the Branch- 
 es of tlie Ganges , by others beyond it : 
 Some efteem Chatigan its cheif City, when 
 as others will have it to be Gtnrt on the 40 
 Ganges , higher in the Land, and more 
 then 100 Leagues from tht Sea. How- 
 r/er it be. Bei^aU is of fo great Traffick, 
 and fo rich, that the Kingdom and Gulf 
 of Ganges , on which it is at prefent, is 
 called The Kingdom and Gulf of Bengala. 
 TheCityof C^4f/(4» is pleafantly feated 
 on a fair and large River, wliofe imbofure 
 is not fardiftant from that of ihe Ganges, 
 ■ This River hath fo fierce a Current, iliat Jo 
 Boats and Keffels, without the help of Sails 
 or Oars, are driven in 24 hourt abcut 100 
 Miles i, fo that ihofc who have no occa- 
 fion to pafs up and down this River, are 
 forced to fallen their Ve^els to certain 'i rees 
 or other thingi which are for the fame pur- 
 pofc fixed along the fliore. By wliicii 
 means they are (hcltered from the violence 
 of the Ticlcs, which clfc vrould fpoil them. 
 
 At the entrance of this River, as Mr. Lttvit 
 Rfterts in his Book of Commerce noteth, 
 is a place which the Inkabitants and Mer^ 
 chants do yearly build in form of 2 FiUaga 
 which tliey make of Reeds, Straw, Branch- 
 es oi Trees, or the like; which though a 
 riUare, yet is of a great largenefs, to 
 which place they bring all manner oi. Mer- 
 chandize to meet the Ship , which at a 
 certain fet time, with the Menfoms, come 
 hither for Trade, who for want of Water 
 are not able to go liigher : And when the 
 Ships are gone with the change of the 
 Monfoen, and that years trading part, they 
 carry up their Goods and Merchandizes to 
 the City of Chatigan in Boats and Barks, 
 and burn their faid Town, leaving it until 
 the next year; at which time and feafon 
 aforefaid, they build it again. There arc 
 feveral other Cities in this Kingdom, as 
 RagmeheSy Dekaia ot'Daca, Banara, Tan- 
 da, r^tana •, Holohafje or Halebaffe on the 
 joyning of Gemini and Ganges, is one of 
 the faircft and greateft Cities of India i 
 and I cfteem it in the place of the Ancient 
 Pilibothra, where the ftreams of the^o- 
 manes and the Ganges do meet, witli other 
 Citiesof lefs note' 
 
 This Kingdom of Bekgala extends it 
 felf 300 Leagues from Eait to Weft, and 
 fometimes 200 from North to South , 
 having no lefs then a 150 Leagues of 
 Coaft, which is much frequented by Mer-. 
 chants oi feveral Countrcys, which hither 
 come for their Commodities, which by rea- 
 fon of the temper ..rnefs of the Air, and 
 the fertility of the Conntrej, it abounds in 
 feveral rich Commodities, as ftore of Fruits, 
 Sugars, S Pices, Comfits, Cotton, and Cotton- 
 cloth of divers forts, which are here made 
 in great quantities. Long-Peffer, ojloi 
 Zerfeline , quantity of Lacqne, Silks, as 
 well thofe made by Worms, as thofe drawn 
 irom Herbs, Canes, plyable, though maf- 
 fic , which Nature fcems in pleafure to 
 diverfifie. So great quantity of il/«, thac 
 It is able to furnifh all its Neighbors ; load- 
 ing yearly divers Ships with it alone, which 
 with thefeother Commodities, do common- 
 ly finde loading for al)0Ut Forty Sail of 
 oood Ships every year. They have all 
 torts of Animals, fr»»/i;»,bcing with them 
 as common as Beef and Mutton with us. 
 The Inhabitants are courteous, but de-

 as rich and as powerful as any in India.

 The Inhabitants of Boldia or Siami are 
 efteemed the moft honcft and civil of all 
 thefe quarters: So that tliey cannot but be 
 people of Trade •, and indeed all thefc 
 Kingdoms have divers Commodities which 
 make them rich. 
 
 The Kingdom of Pi'^K.which hath com- 
 manded, and had forSubjcdls or Tributa- 
 ries almoft all thefc Eftates •, and iikewife 
 others towards Sitn % and Sian it felf can- 
 not but be extreamly ncli and powerful. 
 And truly, CtfW, Silver, Pearls, zniert- 
 (torn Stones, have been as common in the 
 Courts of the Kings of Ptgu, as if all the 
 Orient had brought all its riches thither. 
 In Statues of Gold, and in Cambaltn^M , 
 there hath been more then fixty Millions 
 of GoU , without having regard to the 
 Pearls and Prec:om Stones, which ferved 
 for Crowns and Ornaments to thefc Sta- 
 tues 5 and which were worth more then 
 the Gold, though they were maflive. The 
 Floors of Buildings , 'he Moveables, and 
 the yejfels, with which they ferved them- 
 felves for divertifement, were fo iniichcd 
 within and without, withc«/</and Azure, 
 that It IS not imaginable, if we did not 
 know this to be the Aurea Regio, and like- 
 wife the Argenten Regto of Ptolomj . Yet 
 this muft be believed to have been long 
 fince-, but however, that it is at prefent 
 the richeft Countrey of all the Iniies ■ 
 And for the fame reafon, one of the beft 
 peopled, and moft poweriul. 
 
 ThisCountrc)', by reafon of the over- 
 flowing of the River Pegu^ which runs 
 througli the Kingdom, makes it become 
 exceeding fruitful, and ot a fat and rich 
 foyl •, fo that it produceth great ab jndance 
 ot Grains^ Fruits^ and other products of 
 the Earth in great plenty. Alio Beafls, 
 Forvl, and Ftjh, great plenty of Ctvet-Cats, 
 from whom they take Civet ^ Lacijue, which 
 is'made by Ants (as Bees make ITax with 
 us) Goldy Silver, Precioiu Stones, Drugs, 
 Sfices, Lead, Sugar, &c. 
 
 This Kingdom hath plenty of good rt/rt, ,r 
 Towns and Cities, its Metropolis bearing !1'';''/X 
 the name of the Kingdom. This City of ^^'j w 
 Pegu is divided into t he old and the Netp 5 
 the one and the other together make a 
 Square-, being encorapafTed with aftrong 
 Wall, and a great Ditch well fortified, 
 having on eacli fide five Gates , bcfides

 many Crodedils for the watching the place

 to pafs in and out. The Streets are very 
 fair , ftraight, and fo broad, that fifteen 
 
 20 men may ride a breft on both fides. The

 Wtttrs in feveral places ; the common

 husbtadrj \ as alfo dandering, fwearing, 
 lying, theft, and generally all Ficts, which 
 they fererely punilh , and oftentimes to 
 death. 
 
 Their Arms areefteemed the moft«rx- 
 cellent of all the indus^ they being more 
 valiant and warlike then ihtChinoiSy and 
 more patient of labor ? one of their Kihis 
 conceived nolefs then that he conkl con- 
 quer ckind , and to this purpofe levied 
 there a or jocxjoo Men,which went againd 
 it, and brought back good booty. They 
 Jiave long uled the Art of Frtnting^ they 
 are very civil, and much given to vifitt atn 
 entertainments i they delight in rich and 
 
 coftly furniture in their W**//, with ihea- 
 dornment of ViCInrtStCdbintts, ArifiSit^rc, 
 They are very puniJlual in performing tlieir 
 promifes. 
 
 In Matters of Religion they are for the I' 
 fnoft pait Gentiles, adoring anciently the k 
 Sun, Moon, and Stars, giving adoration to 
 VFilde Beafls ; but th?y cheifly worfhip 
 the Devil , and that partly for fear ot 
 
 lo hurting them ; To which purpofe, they 
 have iif all their F/f«</«, which are nume- 
 rous, feveral ill-fhapcn Figures which they 
 [•ray to. And to tnefe Pdgodes, there be- 
 ongeth a great many Pritfis , to whom 
 thty fliew a great^pedf, and allow a good

 from other perfons, and live a v?ry ftrid 
 life, abftaining from J/cj^, even to the

 20 Amongft them they have feveral Stih, 
 which poflibly are fo many different ways 
 in performing their Devotions , in which 
 they are n^- over ftrid>, nor over devout. 
 Someof t m believe the Immortality ot 
 tlie Sour^ that the Body is reduced to its 
 fii ft principle, ami becomes duft and aflies ; 
 and that tnc Soul is either raifed to joy, or 
 condemned to eceiiul forrow , believing 
 the Xefurreffioiti, and that at its return in- 
 
 jo to the World, it ftiall finde good or evil, 
 according to its anions: Whereas others 
 make no account of thediflblurion of the 
 World , nor put any difference between 
 tlie Souls of Mei$ and Bed/ls. 
 
 They are very jealous of their fTives 
 and CoiKuhnes , not admitting them the 
 liberty of walking abroad, or lociety with 
 men at home) they are very modeft , and 
 not given t6 meddle with any kinde of 
 
 40 bufinefs that appertains to their HmiunJs. 
 Adultery they fevertly punifli, but Fomi- 
 eutivn is permitted amongft them : They 
 are very indulgent to their Children, and 
 give them good education : They ire very 
 tender of their honor, being ftiieof doing 
 any thing which may ectiipe it ; and as 
 they will give no injuries to others, (bthey 
 will take none.

 Oxen] The jlrah of Nuiia, Sanutus, and 
 fomc others, eftcem Tunis to anfwcr to the 
 Ancient Tarfts. This place ( as Hijlin 
 notcrh) is oblcrvable intheW/tfwyof the 
 Hch liars, for the Sieges and Succcfles 
 of two of our Englifh Phncis, viz. Ed- 
 ward the Firft, in his Fathers life time ^ 
 an.l Henry the Fourth, then but Eail of 
 Burh ; by both, of which, the City was 
 forced to a compofition. 
 
 But tlielluincsof C4r//;<«(jf, from which 
 Tunis had its increafe are remarkable ; 
 becaufe of the Aniiijitiij^Scituation, Grtat- 
 nefs , and Power of tliis C/rj, The "be- 
 ginning of it « given to Dida^ ihi Ph.tni- 
 r/4ff, wlioincloledwitha Wall the quar- 
 ter, or C.t(ltc of By; [4, which is two miles 
 and a half ui Circuit, which in the'Coun- 
 t)y thtyft.ll call B:rf.ic, and Bjrfa fignt- 
 fymga IJ/de to the Greeks, and a Fertrrfs 
 to the rktnicians-, tie one agrees with the 
 Fable that D:do liad bought, and bnilded 
 the place on the great nefs and extent of an 
 Oxes Hide : the other to tl^.c Satuatien 
 and advantage of the place, where t!iis 
 f#r/r?/jr was built. ThisSctiuaiion, ana 
 the gooJntfs of the neiglibouiing Pert, 
 crew (o m:ny Petple, that it became one 
 ofthc fhircft Ciiies int!iewo:ld. Its cir- 
 cumference in its fplcndor was jtfo Sudij, 
 li!<e to that of Bthlon , and its Inhabi- 
 tants have been io rich and powerful that 
 they difputed with the JitmAis, for ttic 
 Empire ot tie World, being once called 
 the Lady anJ Miftrefs of Affrica. 
 
 The paiticuhr power of thisCz/jr, was 
 not known till the third and lafl Pumck 
 war-., when alter havng had 10 do with 
 MAfinif[.t , to whom they yielded a good 
 part of their Eftates •, after having granted 
 and put into the Romans liands ; their 
 ShtPsoi War, their Elefhanls their Armes, 
 ana their //«/?j^« which were dtnsanded : 
 when theyconimanded them to leave the 
 Ciiy, and to inhabite from the 5m Coaft, 
 dclpare made them refolvc on the War: 
 They made other Armrs, built new Ships, 
 the Women and Virfins giving their hair to 
 mAt Cables, and Corda^t, and defended 
 ihemfelves yet three or tour years. 
 
 It was afterwards reftored, and at divers 
 times, but the VandaUs, and in theend 
 xhe Anhts have wholly ruint '. it, there 
 not remaining above 7 or 800 houfes of 
 fijhermen. Car diners, &e. 
 
 The Government of S U S A or 
 SUSA, contains the Ciiits oi ffamma- 
 mttt..^ or Machometes , of Sufa, ot Mt- 
 naflero, (jrc. Hammametht communicate 
 
 itsnametothe neighbouring C*y, at the 
 bottom whereof it is fcituated, its Walls 
 are ftrong, and its Harhnriaie. iSufa 
 is in a higher and lower Ciij \ the for- 
 mer on a Kock, and of difficult accefs; 
 the laft on the Sea , vith a good Port, 
 where are laided great quantities of Ojles: 
 both the one and the other well built. 
 The Duke of Savej made an enteiptize 
 
 10 on them in 1619. j. Monafltro which 
 the Arab of Nuiia calls, Lemta of old 
 Lefta Minus, is known by us under the 
 name of Monaflcro, becaufe there was 
 once a iimovA Menaflerj of the Order of 
 St, Auguflsne. The riches about Sufa is 
 in olives, tears, and other Fruits, and 
 Pa/fures for Cattel. The ordinary Food, 
 for the Inhabitants is Barlej-bread, the 
 Country affording no other Grain. Tl'.e 
 
 20 Inliabitants of Sufa and Hammametha 
 addiiJt themfelves to Trafick, others to 
 Wiiitning ot C/o/A, they make Charcoal, 
 and draw fomc profit from their Fipj- 
 ing. 
 
 The Government of AFF RIG A or 
 E L-M tt D I A, hath nothing confide- 
 rable-, but this place may be made for 
 better than it is: Its fcituation is in a Pt- 
 ninfula, which touches not the maine, 
 
 30 but by an Iflhmm of two or 300 paces, 
 wherethereislikewifc fome Mar(h» and 
 on this fide the City is inverted with a 
 double Wall, and good Ditches: Its 
 Port within the City is capable to lodge 
 50 Galleys, but its entrance is fo narrow, 
 that a Galley is forced to lift up its Oares 
 topafs. The Chriftians took and pillaged 
 Monaflero, and Affrica in 1550. 
 
 The Coafts about Sufa and Affrica, 
 
 40 have been well known io the Ronun Hi/lo- 
 ry in the time of the Wars between C^/ir, 
 and the party of Pompey. C*far, landed 
 at Rhufpina, now Sufa, Adrmmetum, novi 
 Hammametht being in the Enemies hands; 
 and in the beginning had divers little fa- 
 vourable encounters theieabout .• In the 
 end he happily defeated both Scipio, and 
 •^11^4 ncer to Thapfut, now Affrica^, and 
 after that defeate, Cato defpairing flew 
 
 50 himfelf at W//V/«, now Kenjeria: Scipio 
 faved himfelf in fome Ships j but being 
 met bv C*(*rs Fleet, paflinjj his fword 
 througn his body, he precipitated him- 
 felf into the Sea. "fuba would have re- 
 tired to Ztma, where he had left his 
 Wives, children , and Treafures \ but 
 Zamd having refufed to open him the 
 Gates; he and Pr(rf;iw retired into a houfe

 drefs , in which they arc not over curi- 
 ous. 
 
 Among the many Parities in this Conn- 
 trey, I fliall content my felf with onclv two 
 or three s and Hrft, About five mik's troiii 
 Cairo , as one Stephen Duplies , a jjiavc 
 and fober man reports , as being an eye 
 witnefs, faitli, That thcie is a place, ui 
 which,on every Good Friday, thcw nppeais 
 the Heads, Arms landLepoi Men, rilini; 
 out of the ground, and that to a vxiy 
 
 10 great number •, and if a man draws nigli 
 them , or doth touch them , they u;ll 
 flirink into the Earth again : A thin.; , 
 which if true, is an exceeding great wo.t 
 der , denoting the Refurredlion of tln' 
 whole Body. But this is not imixjlfiblc, 
 though very improbable. 
 
 They have inthisCountrcy a Raceot 
 Horfes , which for one property may be 
 efteemed the beft in the World •, tliat is, 
 
 20 they will run vi'ithout eating or drtnkin^, 
 one jot, four days and niglits together : 
 And there are Tome Enftians, whic'i with 
 the help of a Sway liound about their 
 body, and carrying with them a little food 
 to eat, are able to ride tliem. Tor ihape, 
 thefe Horjes donot furpafs others ; and for 
 this property they arc held fo raie, and 
 cfteemeu at three years ot age,to be worth 
 1000 pieces of Eight, and fometimes 
 
 30 more: Andforthisbrealof //#r/"«, there 
 aie officers appointed to look alter them, 
 and to fee the f4les of them, and to regi- 
 fter them in a Book with the coloui , ^c. 
 which they receive from the reftimonv ot 
 credible perfons, to avoid cheats. But 
 thefe Htrfes aienot fit for any other then 
 fuch aSandy Countrey, by r«ifonof their 
 tender feet. 
 But let us come to the Nile, which is 
 
 40 the principal piece in all E^pi- I hoW ic 
 for one of the moft confidcrable Rivers ot 
 the World. The length of its courfe , 
 and the diveit Mouths by which it dif 
 charges it felf into the Sea. Its inundation 
 at a prefixed time, the quality of its Wa- 
 ters, dnd the fertility and richnefs it 
 leaves where it palTes , are my inducing 
 Reafons.

 Its true Sfriiig is likewife almoft un-

 comes out of the Lake of Zair, and takes 
 its courfe towards the North , is that 
 which we call the Nile .■ But thij Lake re-

 the Ocean then to fwell^and under ground

 But there are (b many diflcrent opinions 
 touching the caufe of th\slninuUtien, and 
 fo many Reafons are givenfrff and cM,thac 
 a whole Treatife might be made of it. 
 Cakriil Simile and y#A» Hefrcnite Mart- 
 Mites, in a Treatife they have put before 
 
 ccives a number of Rivers which defcend lo the Ceegraphj of an Arai of Nuiia , re- 
 
 from the Mountains of the MtM. To 
 tell whether any of thcfe Rivers bears the 
 name of Nile, and which they be, cannot 
 be done: Though there have been Kings 
 of £^f' > Rtman Emperors, Saltans, and 
 Kings of Portugal, wnich have made the 
 fearc h . In fum , and according to PttUmjy 
 who hath faidasmuch as any hitherto, it 
 mud be that moft advanced towards the 
 
 ^xtaiter At0-Chalil-Ben-Aalij that this 
 iHundatioif comes from a dew which falls 
 atacertaintime,known there by the Eartit 
 weighing more after the dew begins to fall, 
 and lefs before. 
 
 This Inundation begins about the Hx- 
 teenth or feventeenth of June, increafes 
 for thefpace of forty days, and decreafes 
 for other forty days ; fo that its greateft 
 
 
 South, and which waflies at prefent the jo height is about the end of ifulj , and it

 At the coming out of the LiJte, the 
 Kile pafTes between the Kingdoms of 
 J)4mtut and Cojame in the Atj/inei ^ rr- 
 ceives a little on this fide the£4Mr«r, the 
 ZafHan, which comes out of the Lake of

 Ueved to be the true Nile. Thefe three the People are advertifcd, to the end , 
 Rivers are the greateft of all thofe which they may take order for what they have 
 disburthen themfelves in the Nile, and to do. 
 
 carry « great many others. The King Msrit had exprefly caufed to 
 
 But va Egjft tht Nile remains alone, 40 be dug the Lake of JV^crv, to receive the 
 pafles between two ranks of Mountains , Waters of the iV//;,when it had too much. 
 
 approaching the Sea, the Valley enlarges, 
 and the Nile divides it felf into many 
 Branches, and glides by many Months to 
 the Sea. The Ancients made account of 
 fcven, nine, or more, now except in the 
 tune of Inundation, there are onelytwo 
 principal ones { which pafsby Rofetio and 
 Dsmiata; and three leffer by Turket,

 they remedy it when little, hy channels, 
 advanced towards the higher Countrey, 
 that they may be watered : When too 
 much, by certain Fleed-gattt which they 
 open to let the water Aide away. 
 
 For the effeft of this Inundation , is,' 
 That all that the Nile covers with its Wa- 
 
 Btnrles^ and Maala : Thcfe not being 5oter, is made fruitful, and no more. Ic 
 
 Navigable, but during the Inundation ^ 
 the otners always. 
 
 This Inundation of the Nile is wonder- 
 ful , fome attribute it to certain Ettfian 
 winds that is North- Weft, which repulfe 
 the currant, andmakeitfwell: Others to 
 the quantity of Snows which melt ; and 
 to the continual Rains which fall there. 
 
 Rains fometimes in the Lower £nf/>f, very 
 Lttle in the Higher, and not fufficient to 
 moiftenthe Earth ^ but when the Nile in- 
 creafes too much, or too little, it dotli 
 hurt : At I a Cubits, it is yet Famine» at 
 1 5 or itf fuiHcient ^ at 1 8 or zo abundance.

 The Ancient Rmtnt were a gallant

 vetous of glory,of great valor, as may ap-

 The Spring of the f/ff^M^f, according 
 to the report of its Inhabitants, is not a- 
 bove a dayes journey diftant from the fa- 
 mous Lake of Parima, and thence takes its 
 coarfe ftr twenty daycs joatney to the Sea^ 
 
 into which it difchargcs it felf 5 It is inter- 
 rupted by uivers Cataraifs, which hinders 
 its being navigable for any confiderable 
 way , which caufes the Inland Countrey 
 not to be fo perfealy difcovered , as it 
 might be were it otherwife.' 
 - The Brehice and Ctrretine have little lefs 
 courfe then the Effequebe, and no fewer 
 Cataraffs ^ the laft hath its mouth to the 
 Sea very large, but not de^p. 
 
 The Marruvine is no lefs then Four or 
 five thoafmd Geemetrical paces broad at its 
 mouth , and the length of its courfe is 
 efteemed to be thirty or forty dayes jour- 
 ney. The Enelijh who ha^e mounted this 
 :':iver farther then any others, have obfer- 
 ved aboundance of Rivers , which lofe 
 themfelves in it 5 and fay, that here is 
 found the Senfitive Plant, or Hnl, which 
 hath this natural propriety, to clofe, if ne- 
 ver fo little touchecl , and to fhut up its 
 Fltmrs, and fade, if the leaft fprig be 
 took from It, not opening its leaves till a 
 good while after. AllthMe Rivers, for the 
 moft part, have their Cataraffs uixitt the 
 fame Parallel, within four or five degrees 
 of Latitude on this fide the Eifuattr, which 
 may make us judge that there is fome 
 ridge of Mountains, or at leaft a continu- 
 ed eminence , which makes thefe Coun- 
 tries within Land of a higher fcituaiion 
 then thofe Ports neighboured by the

 Cayanna hath likewife in it thofe Moun-

 us fpeak a word or two, of the tempera- 
 ment, and quality of tlie /"«/ of thefe quar- 
 ters, in whicli rliere is fome thing extra- 
 ordinaty. 
 
 It is true that Guiana is under, or very 
 ncer the Equisttr ^ that part which ftretches 
 mofl within land, and the neereft to the 
 jimazones,v, under tlic Equator : from that jq 
 line, the Coaft ftretches on this fide, un-

 fourth, mth, fixth, and feventh of thefe 
 detrees, which is almort in the middle of 
 the Torrid Zone ^ and confequcntly feems

 Eafierne winds^ which do almoft continu- 
 ally blow upon the Coaft, the ntghts being 
 eouall with the daies , the large Rivers 30 
 which refrefti and water the Country, the 
 great dem which fall, the height of their 
 Mountains^ the thicknefj of their /"^rr*/?/, 
 C^f. yield fuchrefrcfliments as renders this 
 Country oneof tliemoft pleafant,and would 
 be made ( were it cultivated ) one of the 
 bfft, and richeft Countrys in all Ameriiu: 
 1 htv have two Summers, and two IVinttrs, 
 their Summers during the Equinoxes^ and 
 their ^Fiff/^rj during the SelJHces\ which ^^ 
 makts their Summers nrncti Awrter then 
 their H inters, particularly that when the 
 Sun 1% in the Sol (I ice of Capricorn : but the 
 fliarpeft of their Winters, is like oar 
 month of yiugufl, the other like our 
 month of May^ and to fpeak truth they 
 have always eitnn Spring or Autumn, their 
 Flowers bemg alwayes in their beauty, 
 their Trees always in tneir verdure,and their 
 fruits ( which are excellent) fit to gather jo 
 all the year long. The aire is fo tempe- 
 rate, and healthful, that thofe of the Coun- 
 try live commonly one hundred, or one 
 hundred and twenty years, fometimes one 
 hundred and fifty, without being fubjed^ to 
 any difeafe, or fickhdS; 
 
 Provifions coft simoii. nothing, all

 all forts of fifh are here very plentifuu, 
 
 they may pafs without our C«r», for 
 making bread, though being fcwed, ic 
 comes to perfeftion in two months.and with 
 a fnller^r<«/>» then it doth with us. They 
 content themfelves with their Manjoe^ 
 with which they can in lefs time and 
 pains make their bread, which they call 
 Caffava i which, when once accuftomed un- 
 to it, is as good amours. 
 
 Their Fensfon are Stags, Buds, mid- ]^^;;

 which are larger, and more delicate then ii^" 
 ours; qMo Turkeys, Pheafants, Partridges,

 than all tlie Fortunes they can leave

 Theie is no nature fo fierce, but may

 But not to fhoot at randome, the

 I conceive, in outward Accomplifli-

 enormous T'/tw, and a kinde of a female 
 vertue; b'lt thefe footfteps of that antient 
 worth, th.it wasinour Anceftors, are too 
 much worn out -, neither are thf. fctds of

 qualiti'.s of the minde do commonly lun 
 (as I may f.iy ) in a blood, and become 
 hereditary ; infomuch that fome Families 
 ret.iin proper C«/?*»».» naturalized in them; 
 as in Rorne, the Pz/oV were frugal, the 40 one ftroak of the h 
 Mete/li , religious; the Manln^ auftere; fpiing likewjw.i'r

 the diflereiice m temperature (for that 
 doth vary by interchangeable Marriages)

 in matters of Wdrr ] PeliniaCovernmeiit^ 
 Sec. propter fe^ are worthy to be obfer- 
 ved , which that UdrnedGtntlemM , and 
 accomplijhed TrdveUer, Sir Henry Blunt., in 
 his voyage to the Levdnt , hath fo well 
 treated of : nay, even in China, their good 
 Laws , and Cuftoms are to beobfervedj 
 but the knowledge of their Povvcr is of 
 little purpofe for us , fincc it can neither 
 advantage , nor Iiinder us. But the Tra- 
 veller is more concerned in the know- 
 ing of thefc, and the like things in the 
 neighbouring Countreys or Kingdoms, as 
 to their State, Condition, People, &c. 
 as I have already noted-, among which, 
 he fliould firft rightly underftand/"rii»fr, 
 as being the firft Countrey that our 
 Englijh Gentry vifit-, next, Italy t, then, 
 Spain, Germany, Flanders, the Ltm Coun- 
 treys, drc. 
 
 It we truly confider the life of a Travel- 
 ler, It is fpent either in Reading , Medi- 
 tation, or Difcourfe : By the firft, he con- 
 verfeth with the Dead? by the fecond, 
 with Himfclfi and by thclaft, with the 
 Living. 
 
 Among other Particulars, a Travel- 
 ler (liould obfervethelikenefsandfympa- 
 thyofdiftant Nations, 2% the Spaniards , 
 with the Irifh; the French, with the Pole; 
 the German (efpecially the Holfletn-men) 
 with the Englifh, &c. 
 
 Let the 'Traveller afcertain himfelf of 
 this, that if any Foreigner is to be imita- 
 ted in matter or manner of Difcourfe or 
 Complement, it is the /f^/ww , who may 
 be faid to be a Medium betwixt the gra- 
 vity of the Spaniards , the levity of the 
 French, and heavinefs of the Dutch s for 
 he feems to allay the one , and quicken 
 the other two. 
 
 He ouoht to make ufe of external helps 
 and neceflaries as appertain , and arc per- 
 tinent, to the knowledge of Places and 
 Howres , fuch as arc Itineraries . Diaries, 
 Tables.and othetCIiorographical and Cno- 
 inonical Inftruments. 
 
 In Adverfity, it is good to be couragi- 
 ous, yet not fo as to becitherrafli, or 
 fearftil ; and in Profperity to be tempe- 
 rate and chafte, not addifted to Wine, La- 
 civioufnefs or Luxury. 
 
 It is not good to fpeak much of his 
 Countrey , or Friends , but more efpeci- 
 ally in the wayofOftentation, orCom- 
 parifon •, neither is it good too much to ex- 
 crcife tlje Tongue , rfp^ial'" io matter of 
 State or Controverfie j but as it were to 
 be decently and civUly Deaf and Dumb. 
 
 He ought to be veiy circumfpcft in the 
 choycc of Inncs upon the road , and trefti 
 Acquaintance) both which oft times prove 
 very dangerous : and it is good to deport 
 himfelf humbly , and refjpctflively towards 
 his Hoft, his Landlord, his Compani- 
 ons, and Chamber-fellows ; alfo be ci- 
 vil to Domcftical Servants , Strangers, 
 and fuch People as he fhall meet withal 
 10 in his , Travels i and not to be given to 
 Jeering , for the exercifing his Witt -, 
 which may ("as oft times it doth) prove 
 his ruine. 
 
 He ought to be skilfull in Swimming, 
 as being tliat which may fave his life. 
 
 When he travels betimes , it is good 
 
 to have fuch Cordials , and ufeful things 
 
 in a readinefs, as may corroborate his 
 
 Spirits, for the better performing his 
 
 20 Journey. 
 
 U 'i gnod to befparing , and cautious in 
 his Diet, and more cfoecially at Dinner, 
 left crudities being railed by his too much 
 excrcifc , produce the effc^s of grievous 
 Difeafes. 
 
 It is not good for him to expofe him- 
 felf prefently into the cold , when he is 
 hot', but rather to bring his Body to a 
 good temper, by a continual motion, or 
 JO moderate ftitring r, his Body being hot, 
 to abftain from fleeping (in the day- 
 time) ontheGrafTe, or the hke dangerous 
 places. 
 
 It is convenient that he travel well ar- 
 med for his defence againft nMers, or 
 fuddain invafions. 
 
 In the heat of Summer, it is good to 
 Traveliatheitfrningi and in the ffior tr, 
 as he difcems the weather, Co let him fet 
 40 for\Tard his journey , and let him Ihun late 
 hours, butcfpeciallyif he perceives him- 
 felf fubjc^ to Catarrhs ^ or if he intend 
 to avoid the danger of Thieves, and the 
 like ill Conveoicncic^ that purfae late 
 houres. 
 
 In his bahit , it is not good to be too 
 famptuoQs nor too mean; bnt civ J, and 
 faftiionable according to theCumirj where 
 he is. 
 ;o Having hitherto difcoarfed of fuch 
 things which concern a journey^ in the 
 next pla ? I fhall fay fonoething of his 
 (laying at places ) concemioa which 
 there are (eveioi precepts to be obler/ed. 
 
 X. That in thofe places where he is 
 certain to tarry, he be diligent to obferve 
 whatfoever is worthy of his tare or eye^ 
 and accordingly make aaobfavation of it 
 in hisdiary.

 a. That he be mindful of his duty to- 
 wards his Relations, and Friends, by the 
 fending of Letters. 
 
 3. When he arriveth at Paris or any 
 other City, it would be convenient for 
 him to retire, and not to frequent the 
 company of tlie Englifh , which is the 
 greateft impediment to the obtaining the 
 Language, ^c. and in this retirement he 
 muftimploy his time. i. In the reading JO 
 of Bveks, as thofe of the Hijlorj of the 
 Country where he rcfideth; u(o Books of 
 GeozrafhjM Poetry, or tlie like, according 
 
 as his inclinations ferve him .• 2. The 
 frequenting the C»»r« of judicature, Ac- 
 caiemies^ and futlick Schools, which will 
 be found very profitable. 3. It is good 
 that he fpend fome part of liis lim: in 
 MecrtalioHS, ai\d Exereifes, as Riding the 
 great horfe. Fencing, the Tennis Court, (^c. 20 
 but be careful of too much bodily ir v/>- 
 cife, inhot Countryt i hi ten oi' Feavers , 
 or other dilfemfers. 
 
 4. The Meddals and Imprefiotis of 
 Forrain Countrjes he ought to enquire 
 into. 
 
 5. At his Meat , if he hkes his Com- 
 f4»7 he may be freely merry-, but with fo 
 muchfafety, as rather to appear healthy, 
 and comely to a Stranger then Prodigal or 3° 
 extravagant , and let his Difcourje be 
 free and affable, giving entertainment in 
 
 a fweet and liberal manner, and with a 
 cheerful courtefie: and let him feafoniiis 
 difcourfc ( at the Table ) among grave 
 and ferious difcourfes, with conceits of 
 ttit, and pleafant inventions, as ingenious 
 Epigrams, Emblems, Anagrams, merry 
 Tales, with auefiions and anfwtrs, which 
 may excufe him as to the more imperti- 4° 
 nenc enlarging of himfelf about his Conn- 
 try. 
 
 6. Before he entertains a Friend into 
 thedofetof histrefi, let him found his 
 Mitigion % then look into his Life and Car- 
 riage , how he is reckoned, and reputed 
 among Men s then his tiualtty how and 
 wherein he may.be ufeful unto him: for 
 there is nothing more miferable then the 
 want of a Friends counfell, and to admo- 50 
 niflihiminthetime of need, tf^ewantof 
 which hath proved the ruine of mary a 
 yoang Gentleman, and of their poftcrity 
 forever. 
 
 7. Let him hare a care of difcourfing 
 fi'ivolous things amongft Grave and Lear- 
 ned mfw, bud re his Difcturfe and carri' 
 age according tu the Company's Inclina- 
 tions. 
 
 II 
 
 Tra.t.y. 
 
 8. Let him not be apt to report netvs, 
 excrot he be confident of the truth thereof 
 unlefs he quote the Autlior,orDivuIgerof 
 it to him. 
 
 9. If two contend together ( being as n:,„.t;. 
 a Stranger ) he ought not to take part 
 with either, unlefs he be compelled there- 
 unto. 
 
 10. Touching thofe Titles, and Attri- 
 butes which are due to great Perfons, it 
 will be needful for him to obferve the ufe 
 of times, and of the Country, and to take 
 Counfel witli fuch as are beft experienfed 
 therein. 
 
 11. It is an old Proverb, Too much fa- £/<«.»»/> 
 miliarity breeds contempt s and tis alfo 
 a mod certain experience, that Gravity 
 takes oif confidence: but he that can re- 
 ferve to himfelf a familiar kind of flatcli- 
 nefs, that can pleafe without flatterie,and 
 rcpiove without offence -, knows rightly 
 how to behave himfelf : in what part of 
 thelVorld foever he is. 
 
 12. He is to make ufe of time, and to 
 catch every one witli advantage , either 
 by imagining a Friend handfomly, or in 
 overcoming an Enemy, fo as to make 
 him incapable of doing him an injcry. 
 
 It is not enough for they our / Traveller 
 to know principles in the U i ; but he 
 muftexercifethcmby experience; it will 
 be therefore expedient to wean himfelf 
 from his delights at home by feeing that 
 there arc other 0//«, Men, and Manners 
 then thofe of his own Country ; wiiich 
 excites the divers fencimencs in him, and 
 thediverfity of things fenfible; becaufe 
 the Power indifferent of it fclf cannot be 
 determined but by the Objeft; the Anions 
 of the mind, are the fame-, "nd if we doe 
 not offer it divers things, it cannot but 
 apply it felf to thofe that are prefented to 
 it ; and though the imagination doth 
 often fr4a;f/ without the body, it never le- 
 turnes fully fatisfied ; fancying to it felf 
 things that have no fubftance, but in its 
 own imagination. Unlefs the eyes , and 
 other Jenjes doe ferve and hecorae guides 
 snd companions to it, that which we learn 
 only by reading or hear-fay , we cannot 
 affirm but by the faith ot others -, and 
 though true, yet they are but books and 
 tvordi which are only coppies , and ex- 
 fre^ions, which never have all thegraces 
 and perfeifions of the Original : but he that 
 would know things as they are, nluft draw 
 them from the Springhead -, for there

 or Travel; and this is undertaken for the 
 knowledge oi foreign Languages. 
 
 1. fik Topographical Travel , and this is 
 
 verfion oi people in ftrange Countrjs that 
 are ignorant of the Gofpei s and this is 
 cither lawful, or unlawful. Lawful! when 
 he profciTeth that Relirion in anotlicr

 certain nrofeflion of hfe , that is, either 
 hijitrrcally , aflronomically, mercantily, or

 Of Exchanges* 
 
 Exchange of Money \i of great antiquity, 
 and is cdccmcd exceeding commodi- 
 ous , excellently uleful and beneficial, as 
 well to Kingdoms and Ciitet in general, 
 5S t(i Merchants , and otheis in particular. 
 And 3s Monj\va% firft invented to be made 
 
 Seeing that Exchanges are of fifth great 
 ufc and importance , tne Merchant ought 
 to have great inlight and knowledge in the 
 Cojns oi foreign Counirejt, that he may be 
 able to reduce oneCfj/p into the valuation 
 of another, by raifing or abating, accord- 
 ing to the goodnefs or badndfs of the Met- 
 tal, that when he hath occafion to draw 
 a Bill of Exchange , upon one of a 1000 (, 
 
 of tlic b<:(\ Mettalt, for the avoiding of 10 here at London, tohtpaid in frMce^Mtl- 
 
 ch.i:cea'jle and troublelbm carriage and 
 tranlportation of Commodities from one 
 place to another in way of trade 5 fo 
 Wis Exchat^es of Monejs firft invented 
 for the avoiding, as well the danger, as 
 the trouble and charge in the carriageof 
 Moneys from place to place. And by rea- 
 fon that the Standaras , Stamps , and In- 
 fcriptions of Mtnqs are fouml tobcvari- 
 
 /W,oreirewhere,hemay know the l«lsor 
 gain. 
 
 The true exchange for Moneys by Bills 
 of Exchange is really grouoded upon the 
 vtlnaiion, finene/?, and weight of thei/#- 
 ney , of every Coniltrcy, according to the 
 Far, that is value for value 5 and on this 
 are thcExchanges oi EnfUnd grounded. 
 
 Exchanges are made by Bills, when M*- 
 
 ous, and different , no Nation making ufe 20 Mf; is delivered iimply here in England, and 
 
 of anotheis Coyns , forced them ( for the 
 better perfbrmaiKe j to appoint a certain
