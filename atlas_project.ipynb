    "The first thing I noticed was the sheer scope of the book. In all 4 sections it covers the nearly the entire world and a huge amount of knowledge for the time (1677) across 600 pages. Each section is generally split into countries/regions and then notable cities. Decriptions are given and each area is judged by its rivers, lakes, woodlands, mines, cattle, agriculture, and manufacturing of goods. Also provided by the atlas are the cities' natural defences, ports, if they are frequented by seamen or merchants, and how profitable trade is to them. I focussed my research on the section on the UK. However, we will see later how, with help from AI, research on the atlas's other sections could be done efficiently.\n",

Societal structure such as laws, the function of the King, parliament, Justices of the Peace and Archbishops are discussed.\n",

    "Blome describes England as having \"sweet and temperate air.\" The weather of each season is added. The land is said to be fertile, providing many grains such as wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Farming land for cattle and sheep are said to be abundant, along with the sky containing many birds. Fish are an important commodity traded and salted herring and pilchards are sent to Spain, France, and Italy. Lead, tin, and coal are mined for great profit. Butter, cheese, and fruits are also mentioned. Blome then discusses the customs of English people, before moving on to the Royal Navy - a \"wooden wall,\" the ships are a \"safety to the nation and a terror to strangers.\" He writes about the docks where the King's ships are built, and which harbours and ports are the best for trade. The author then goes into great detail about the nation's currency and how goods are weighed, measured and valued. English commodities for trade are then listed.\n",

    "Using the atlas again, we can explore the topic creatively by looking at the object's provenance. As mentioned in chapter 1, the copy of <i>A Geographical Description of the Four Parts of the World</i> handled in this project was actually owned by a 17th century Scottish mariner. It is very likely this exact atlas was used aboard his ships on various trade voyages, of which we have records of. Maclean discusses this in his paper <a href='resources/MacLean_v2.pdf' download><i>The Library of Captain John Anderson, a seventeenth-century Glasgow Mariner</i></a>, part of <i>The Journal of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, number 18</i> (2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "Captain John Anderson (active 1662-ca. 1695) was a Scottish mariner, ship master, and merchant from Glasgow. Often commanding his ship, the <i>Providence of Glasgow</i>, he traded in both Europe and the Carribbean. Echoing information provided by the atlas, Maclean writes of wine and olive oil being imported from Spain, with exports being in fish, butter and cloth. The Scottish captain sails to the Caribbean to export manufactures, and returns with tobacco and sugar. These goods traded by the captain are evidenced also in the invoice scraps used to repair the atlas - mentioning barrels of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "MacLean explores writings of Captain Anderson in his paper which discuss the dangers of maritime trade in the 1600s. There is mention of pirates, which necessitates a convoy to accompany his ship, which is armed with cannons. When voyages are undertaken with no convoy, the captain states he is at risk of mutiny from an angry crew. On another occasion he again risks mutiny from an overworked crew unloading his ship at night. While in the woods sourcing timber for shipbuilding in Ireland, the captain is in danger of being killed or robbed by bandits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storms are dangerous in the 17th century and are associated with witchcraft aiming to sink ships. Books in Captain Anderson's collection are adorned with markings to ward off evil and offer spiritual protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the technology we have today, Captains of trade ships in the 17th century relied on oral communication, intuition, and memory. Communication overseas was an important job of merchants, who had to have knowledge of different languages and customs. Many mid-17th century ships had no surgeon aboard, meaning lack of proper medical care for the crew.\n",

    "As seen in the diagram, generative AI is a branch of machine learning (ML) called deep learning. ML systems are AI systems that can learn by themselves. They do this using a model with an algorithm that can make predictions based on input data. Deep learning takes this further by incorporating artifical neural networks (ANN). These are made up of serveral layers with nodes that transform the input data to make predictions. ANNs mimic the model of neurons in the brain. Generative AI uses ANNs to learn patterns present in training data to produce a model. That model then has the ability to generate new outputs that have similair characteristics to the training data.\n",

    "We can already see that this transcription is much more accurate than the one provided by HathiTrust. While there are many uses for the extracted text data, we will focus on summarising and asking questions about it with ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the text is copy and pasted into ChatGPT and prompted with 'Summarise the text' we get the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "The text appears to be a historical and geographical account of the British Isles, focusing on the early divisions and administrative structures of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Here's a brief summary of the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Historical Overview**: It describes the British Isles as a group of many islands, with Great Britain (initially called Albion) and Ireland (initially called Hibernia) being the largest. The text traces the ownership changes of these lands, from various independent peoples before Roman occupation through the Roman period, and later into the hands of the English Saxons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Saxon Heptarchy**: It details the division of England into seven kingdoms by the English Saxons: Kent, South Saxons, East Angles, East Saxons, West Saxons, Northumbers, and Mercia.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unification under Egbert**: Egbert, the King of the West Saxons, is credited with subduing the Saxon Heptarchy kingdoms and styling himself as the first monarch of the unified territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Administrative Divisions**: The text outlines the administrative divisions of England into shires or counties, established by King Alfred the Great. It describes the judiciary system, including the appointment of sheriffs and the establishment of shire courts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ecclesiastical Structure**: The division of England into ecclesiastical jurisdictions, including archbishoprics and bishoprics, is detailed. A list of bishops and their dioceses as of June 1668 is provided, alongside the counties under their jurisdiction and the revenues attributed to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Geographical Descriptions**: Specific counties and their notable towns and cities are described, highlighting their economic activities, geographical features, and historical significance. Kent, Surrey, and Sussex are among the areas covered, with mentions of cities like Canterbury and towns like Dover.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Cultural and Social Aspects**: The document touches on the social and cultural fabric of the time, including the nobility, the legal system, and the economic livelihood of the people, emphasizing agriculture, trade, and the maritime importance of the isles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary encapsulates the essence of the text, which serves as a historical and geographical ledger of the British Isles during a time of significant transition and unification, focusing on the period's administrative, ecclesiastical, and societal structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When prompted with 'Tell me about maritime trade information found in the text' we get the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "The text mentions several aspects of maritime trade and the importance of the sea for the British Isles, emphasizing how the region's geographical features and resources contributed to its maritime activities. Here are the key points related to maritime trade:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strategic Ports and Sea Access**: The text identifies several key ports, including Dover, which is noted for its strategic importance due to its strong defensive position and its role as a principal port for trade and travel between England and France. Dover's commodious haven and the short passage to France are highlighted, suggesting its significant role in facilitating maritime trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fishing Industry**: The text describes the seas and rivers as being rich with a variety of fish, indicating a thriving fishing industry. Specifically mentioned are herrings and pilchards, with herrings described as a staple commodity that enjoys good trade with Spain, France, and other countries. This suggests that fishing was not only important for domestic consumption but also as an export commodity, contributing to the maritime trade economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shipbuilding**: The mention of places like Deptford for the building and repairing of the King's ships suggests an established shipbuilding industry, critical for maintaining the fleet that supported both military and commercial maritime activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maritime Defence and Security**: The reference to Gravesend and its role in securing the passage into the Thames highlights the importance of maritime defense and the protection of trade routes. The presence of blockhouses and other fortifications suggests that safeguarding maritime trade routes and ports was a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Trade Routes and Commodities**: The text implies the existence of active trade routes, particularly across the English Channel to France, but also to more distant markets like Spain. The export of fish and the likely import of wine and other goods indicate a diversified trade network. The text's emphasis on certain ports as being key to trade and defense underscores the importance of maritime trade to the economy and security of the British Isles.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Naval Power and \"Wooden Walls\"**: Although not detailed in the excerpts you provided, the allusion to England's ships as its \"wooden walls\" suggests recognition of the naval power's role in protecting the realm and securing its trade interests. This metaphor highlights the strategic importance of a strong navy for defending trade routes and ensuring maritime trade's safety and prosperity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text paints a picture of the British Isles as a region deeply connected to and dependent upon the sea for its economic prosperity, security, and engagement with the wider world through maritime trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this information in chapter 8 when discussing what 17th century maritime trade was like, before comparing it to modern global trade."

    "\n",
    "From our reading and the list above, we can see that many good were traded between Britain and other countries during the 17th century, when the atlas was written. The author of <i>A Geographical Description of the Four Parts of the World</i> describes grains, fish and wool to be cheif exports. Blome then goes on to list many imports that include wines and oils. It is clear that, according to the author, global trade has already been established by the late 1600s, with imports and exports taking place in Europe as well as Asia. Let's take a look at further other literature to corroborate our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zahedieh in her modern scholarly article <a href='https://academic.oup.com/book/37233/chapter/329750398'><i>Overseas Expansion and Trade in the Seventeenth Century</i></a> goes into detail on the establishment of maritime trade in 17th century Britain. She states that while maritime trade was not large at the time, \"even in 1700 it accounted for about 20 per cent of total overseas commerce,\" it was nontheless important in the development of the nation. The trade stimulated finacial investment and growth in diverse new industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prominent imports of the time were sugar, tobacco, and textiles. Exported was a variety of manufactures such as hats, shoes, stockings, and ribbons (as also listed by Blome). While both Blome and Zahedieh mention the import of textiles from India, Zahedieh is the ony one to discuss the large impact of imports from American colonies (sugar and tobacco).\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Overseas Expansion and Trade in the Seventeenth Century</i> gives us additional insight into the dangers of 17th century maritime trade. The shipping industry is described as offering high profits due to the risks associated - bad weather, war, pirates, market fluctuations, and dishonest agents. Also a factor was the time a voyage took and the space required for bulky cargo. A round trip to America or the Indies could take over a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the atlas again, we can explore this more creatively by looking at the object's provenance. As mentioned in chapter 1, the copy of <i>A Geographical Description of the Four Parts of the World</i> explored in this project was actually owned by a 17th century Scottish mariner. It is very likely this exact atlas was used aboard his ships on various trade voyages, of which we have records of. Maclean discusses this in his paper <a href='resources/MacLean_v2.pdf' download><i>The Library of Captain John Anderson, a seventeenth-century Glasgow Mariner</i></a>, part of <i>The Journal of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, number 18</i> (2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "Captain John Anderson (active 1662-ca. 1695) was a Scottish mariner, ship master, and merchant from Glasgow. Often commanding his ship, the <i>Providence of Glasgow</i>, he traded in both Europe and the Carribbean. Echoing information provided by the atlas, Maclean writes of wine and olive oil being imported from Spain, with exports being in fish, butter and cloth. Also as Zahedieh states, the Scottish captain sails to the Caribbean to export manufactures, and returns with tobacco and sugar. These goods traded by the captain are evidenced also in the invoice scraps used to repair the atlas - mentioning barrels of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "MacLean explores writings of Captain Anderson in his paper which discuss the dangers of maritime trade in the 1600s. Again, there is mention of pirates, which necessitates a convoy to accompany his ship, which is armed with cannons. When voyages are undertaken with no convoy, the captain states he is at risk of mutiny from an angry crew. On another occasion he again risks mutiny from an overworked crew unloading his ship at night. While in the woods sourcing timber for shipbuilding in Ireland, the captain is in danger of being killed or robbed by bandits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storms are dangerous in the 17th century and are associated with witchcraft aiming to sink ships. Books in Captain Anderson's collection are adorned with markings to ward off evil and offer spiritual protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the technology we have today, Captains of trade ships in the 17th century relied on oral communication, intuition, and memory. Communication overseas was an important job of merchants, who had to have knowledge of different languages and customs. Many mid-17th century ships had no surgeon aboard, meaning lack of proper medical care for the crew.\n",
