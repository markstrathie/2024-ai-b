Each section is generally split into countries/regions and then notable cities. Decriptions are given and each area is judged by its rivers, lakes, woodlands, mines, cattle, agriculture, and manufacturing of goods. Also provided by the atlas are the cities' natural defences, ports, if they are frequented by seamen or merchants, and how profitable trade is to them. I focussed my research on the section on the UK. However, we will see later how, with help from AI, research on the atlas's other sections could be done efficiently.\n",

Farming land for cattle and sheep are said to be abundant, along with the sky containing many birds. Fish are an important commodity traded and salted herring and pilchards are sent to Spain, France, and Italy. Lead, tin, and coal are mined for great profit. Butter, cheese, and fruits are also mentioned. Blome then discusses the customs of English people, before moving on to the Royal Navy - a \"wooden wall,\" the ships are a \"safety to the nation and a terror to strangers.\" He writes about the docks where the King's ships are built, and which harbours and ports are the best for trade. The author then goes into great detail about the nation's currency and how goods are weighed, measured and valued. English commodities for trade are then listed.\n",

    "# 3. Global trade, then and nowüö¢\n",
    "\n",
    "From our reading and the list above, we can see that many good were traded between Britain and other countries during the 17th century, when the atlas was written. The author of <i>A Geographical Description of the Four Parts of the World</i> describes grains, fish and wool to be cheif exports. Blome then goes on to list many imports that include wines and oils. It is clear that, according to the author, global trade has already been established by the late 1600s, with imports and exports taking place in Europe as well as Asia. Let's take a look at further other literature to corroborate our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zahedieh in her modern scholarly article <a href='https://academic.oup.com/book/37233/chapter/329750398'><i>Overseas Expansion and Trade in the Seventeenth Century</i></a> goes into detail on the establishment of maritime trade in 17th century Britain. She states that while maritime trade was not large at the time, \"even in 1700 it accounted for about 20 per cent of total overseas commerce,\" it was nontheless important in the development of the nation. The trade stimulated finacial investment and growth in diverse new industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prominent imports of the time were sugar, tobacco, and textiles. Exported was a variety of manufactures such as hats, shoes, stockings, and ribbons (as also listed by Blome). While both Blome and Zahedieh mention the import of textiles from India, Zahedieh is the ony one to discuss the large impact of imports from American colonies (sugar and tobacco).\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Overseas Expansion and Trade in the Seventeenth Century</i> gives us additional insight into the dangers of 17th century maritime trade. The shipping industry is described as offering high profits due to the risks associated - bad weather, war, pirates, market fluctuations, and dishonest agents. Also a factor was the time a voyage took and the space required for bulky cargo. A round trip to America or the Indies could take over a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the atlas again, we can explore this more creatively by looking at the object's provenance. As mentioned in chapter 1, the copy of <i>A Geographical Description of the Four Parts of the World</i> explored in this project was actually owned by a 17th century Scottish mariner. It is very likely this exact atlas was used aboard his ships on various trade voyages, of which we have records of. Maclean discusses this in his paper <a href='resources/MacLean_v2.pdf' download><i>The Library of Captain John Anderson, a seventeenth-century Glasgow Mariner</i></a>, part of <i>The Journal of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, number 18</i> (2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "Captain John Anderson (active 1662-ca. 1695) was a Scottish mariner, ship master, and merchant from Glasgow. Often commanding his ship, the <i>Providence of Glasgow</i>, he traded in both Europe and the Carribbean. Echoing information provided by the atlas, Maclean writes of wine and olive oil being imported from Spain, with exports being in fish, butter and cloth. Also as Zahedieh states, the Scottish captain sails to the Caribbean to export manufactures, and returns with tobacco and sugar. These goods traded by the captain are evidenced also in the invoice scraps used to repair the atlas - mentioning barrels of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "MacLean explores writings of Captain Anderson in his paper which discuss the dangers of maritime trade in the 1600s. Again, there is mention of pirates, which necessitates a convoy to accompany his ship, which is armed with cannons. When voyages are undertaken with no convoy, the captain states he is at risk of mutiny from an angry crew. On another occasion he again risks mutiny from an overworked crew unloading his ship at night. While in the woods sourcing timber for shipbuilding in Ireland, the captain is in danger of being killed or robbed by bandits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storms are dangerous in the 17th century and are associated with witchcraft aiming to sink ships. Books in Captain Anderson's collection are adorned with markings to ward off evil and offer spiritual protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the technology we have today, Captains of trade ships in the 17th century relied on oral communication, intuition, and memory. Communication overseas was an important job of merchants, who had to have knowledge of different languages and customs. Many mid-17th century ships had no surgeon aboard, meaning lack of proper medical care for the crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade now is vastly different. Official UK government [trade in numbers](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-trade-in-numbers/uk-trade-in-numbers-web-version) shows us information on current global trade in 2024. Top 3 exports are cars, mechanical power generators and medicinal and pharmaceutical products. Main counties are US, Germany and Ireland.Top 3 imports are cars, refined oil and machanical power generators. Top countries are US, Germany and the Netherlands.\n",

    "Creative exploration of <i>A Geographical Description of the Four Parts of the World</i> can be aided tremendously with help from generative AI. Here we will use ChatGPT to generate text from the digitised pages of the atlas. While this is possible without the use of AI, it makes the process much more efficient. Text data from the atlas allows us to do the following:\n",

    "- Search the document\n",

    "- Translate into different languages\n",

    "Generative AI performs better than a human reader or non-AI technology because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handwritten sections can be made more legible\n",
    "- Long s (≈ø) is an archaic letter that can be confused for the letter f\n",
    "- Archaic words have different spellings to modern counterparts\n",
    "- It can quickly summarise and transform the text\n",
    "- It can answer questions based on the text\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT manages to achieve these benefits because it uses a large language model (LLM) to check how each letter and word fits together with what comes before and after. It can process this much faster than a human and make less mistakes than non-AI technology."
