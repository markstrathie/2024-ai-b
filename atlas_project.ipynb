    "The first thing I noticed was the sheer scope of the book. In all 4 sections it covers the nearly the entire world and a huge amount of knowledge for the time (1677) across 600 pages. Each section is generally split into countries/regions and then notable cities. Decriptions are given and each area is judged by its rivers, lakes, woodlands, mines, cattle, agriculture, and manufacturing of goods. Also provided by the atlas are the cities' natural defences, ports, if they are frequented by seamen or merchants, and how profitable trade is to them. I researched the section on the UK most intently.\n",

    "Titled \"The British Isles, wherein are the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland,\" this section describes where the islands are located in the world and in relation to one another. Geographical information is included of where each region begins and ends on the islands. There is a brief history of its Roman formation to more current events of the century. Societal structure such as laws, the function of the King, parliament, Justices of the Peace and Archbishops are discussed.\n",

    "Blome describes England as having \"sweet and temperate air.\" The weather of each season is added. The land is said to be fertile, providing many grains such as wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Farming land for cattle and sheep are said to be abundant, along with the sky containing many birds. Fish are an important commodity traded and salted herring and pilchards are sent to Spain, France, and Italy. Lead, tin, and coal are mined for great profit. Butter, cheese, and fruits are also mentioned. Blome then discusses the customs of English people, before moving on to the Royal Navy - a \"wooden wall,\" the ships are a \"safety to the nation and a terror to strangers.\" He writes about the docks where the King's ships are built, and which harbours and ports are the best for trade. The author then goes into great detail about the nation's currency and how goods are weighed, measured and valued. English commodities for trade are then listed.\n",
